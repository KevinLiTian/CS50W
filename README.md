# Harvard University's CS50W - Web Programming

In the summer after my sophomore year, in order to gain more knowledge and continue programming, I chose to study Harvard's online web programming course, [CS50W](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), which I found through the online learning platform, [edX](https://www.edx.org/)<br/>

In this repository, I will put my notes and my work on course projects. For each lecture, I will list the objectives of the lecture and corresponding projects. Detailed notes and in-class examples regarding each lecture can be accessed through the link of the corresponding lecture below

## Course Overview

This course dive deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semesterâ€™s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet

### Web Programming

Web programming/development involves front-end development and back-end development. Front-end is the presentation layer, or the user interface (UI), which can be generally summarized by three languages, HTML, CSS and Javascript, where each one plays an important role in the UI. Back-end is the data access layer, or the database where the data is stored and interacted. This course will discuss thoroughly both the front-end and back-end development of web apps and will also introduce framework and database

- **UI**: Methods used to make a website as easy to use as possible
- **Testing**: Learning about different methods used to make sure updates to web pages proceed smoothly
- **Scalability & Security**: Making sure websites can be accessed by many users at once, and that they are safe from malicious intent

## Lecture 0 - Introduction

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of a web page. CSS is used to customize the appearance of a website. They are interpreted by web browsers (Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) in order to display content on the screen. Git is a version control tool to help programmers to have better workflows. Python is a popular programming language that has a variety of uses

### Objectives

- [HTML & CSS](0.Introduction/HTML_CSS/)
- [Git](0.Introduction/git/)
- [Python](0.Introduction/python/)

### Projects

- [Search](0.Introduction/search/)

## Lecture 1 - [Django](1.Django/)

Django is a Python-based web framework that will allow us to write Python code that dynamically generates HTML and CSS. The advantage to using a framework like Django is that a lot of code is already written for us that we can take advantage of

- Django Features
- TODO List

### Projects

- [Wiki](1.Django/wiki/)

## Lecture 2 - [SQL](2.SQL/)

[SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), or Structured Query Language, is a programming language that allows us to update and query database

### Objectives

- SQLite
